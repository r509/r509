      #
      # A CA may specify that an OCSP client can trust a responder for the
      # lifetime of the responder's certificate. The CA does so by including
      # the extension id-pkix-ocsp-nocheck. This SHOULD be a non-critical
      # extension. The value of the extension should be NULL. CAs issuing
      # such a certificate should realized that a compromise of the
      # responder's key, is as serious as the compromise of a CA key used to
      # sign CRLs, at least for the validity period of this certificate. CA's
      # may choose to issue this type of certificate with a very short
      # lifetime and renew it frequently.
      #
      # You can use this extension to parse an existing extension for easy access
      # to the contents or create a new one.
